**[1] Generate Stacking fault energy & Screw dislocation for bcc crystals**

--> b is a burger vector (b = a/2[111])
GSFE = (E_fault - E_perfect)/Area

**[2] Local-lattice-distortion HEA Alloys**

Analysis of atomic mismatch for High Entropy Alloys. Various definition exists but I have chosen the one given in the paper referenced in the script. These definitions are arbitrary.

The script reads VASP POSCAR & CONTCAR file for initial and final coordinates and then analyse the ions drift from its initial position and compute the atomic mismatch.

**[3] Generating Random Structure using SQS technique or Short range order (SRO) method**

Python script to generate BCC/FCC/HCP random structures using SQS technique. This program is the MODIFICATION of the NANOHUB code.

**[4] Code to convert file generated from MCSQS ATAT code to VASP POSCAR file.**

**[5] Monte Carlo code for generating strucutre with lower Binding energy.**

NB:: For generating the structure you will need to install atomsk. The link is:
https://github.com/pierrehirel/atomsk/ 
it generates POSCAR files and they can be run independently with VASP and after relaxation in the z direction
the energy can be calulated and GSFE can be plotted against normalized burger vector.
